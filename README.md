<!-- Remarks -->
<h2><a id="remark">Remarks</a></h2>
<ul>
    <li>Since I decided to complete the project in one day (which was a critical mistake :sleepy:), I made the last commits in a very tired state, and more specifically these:<br>
    <img alt="sleepy-condition" src="readme_imgs/sleepy_condition.png"><br>
    so I could make very stupid and offensive mistakes in them
    </li>
    <li>
    I also ask you to draw your attention to my other projects. <br> I will go progressively, <b>the further it goes, the more complex and voluminous the project was</b>.<br> If you cannot take the time to look at all the points, then it is better to start from the end. <br> However, I still <b>recommend reading everything from the very beginning, since these points contain a chronology of my growth as a developer</b>:

            <b>Description:</b><br>
            In this project, I decided to make my own completely self-written Gulp config and implement several invented methods; at that time it was very difficult, because I had to code in JavaScript, which I did not know at all.<br>
            <br>
            After that, I decide to study JavaScript in depth and end up getting so immersed that I study the React.js framework and go freelance, completely giving up on Git.<br>

            The project is entirely written in PHP with the Laravel framework.<br>

            <b>Description:</b><br>
            The largest project that has been in development for about 4 months.<br>
            A lot of logic has already been implemented, both in the front-end part, for example <b>full parsing and rendering of markdown files</b>, and in the back-end part, for example <b>creating individual filtering classes and interfaces in OOP.</b><br>
            <br>
            Since this is a commercial project, I will only be able to show some parts of the work of this project. <br>
            <br>
            There is both a video demonstrating the operation of this system and a design file in figma, completely designed by me.
